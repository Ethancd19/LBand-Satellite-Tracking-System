# L-Band Satellite Tracking and Characterization System

Welcome to the central repository for the L-Band Satellite Tracking and Characterization System. This repository serves as a directory and overview for the project, guiding you to the separate components that comprise the full system: the back end and the front end.

## Back End
The back end of our system is the powerhouse behind the operations, handling data processing, signal analysis, and other core functionalities. This crucial part of the project is managed by my partner, who will provide detailed information and updates in the back-end repository.

## Front End
The front end of our system, designed for Linux, offers an intuitive graphical user interface that brings our satellite tracking capabilities to life. It boasts several standout features:

- **Spectrum Plotting**: Users can easily visualize the satellite spectrum, aiding in the analysis and understanding of satellite signals.
- **Schedule Manipulation**: This tool allows for the flexible management of tracking schedules, optimizing the use of satellite tracking resources.

These features represent just a portion of what our GUI can do. The interface is built to accommodate a wide range of satellite tracking and characterization tasks, with more functionalities waiting to be explored.
